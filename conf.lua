-- Game: Run You Fool, You're Gonna Miss Your Train
-- Premise: A working man must reach the metro train in time, in 10 seconds, before the doors close up. 
-- Simple enough, except each station's layout presents the man with an increasing amount of obstacles to surpass.
-- Good luck, you'll need it.
